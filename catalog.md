## ‚≠ê Automated Review Request Workflow

**Problem:**  
Many businesses forget to ask happy customers for reviews, missing out on valuable 5-star ratings.

**How It Works:**
1. Send a personalized thank-you email or SMS after service.
2. Wait 3‚Äì5 days, then send a gentle review request with direct links.
3. If no response, send a polite reminder.
4. Track new reviews and send a monthly report.
5. (Optional) Flag negative internal feedback before public review.

**Benefits:**
- More positive online reviews
- Higher visibility on Google/Yelp
- Set it and forget it ‚Äî all automated!
